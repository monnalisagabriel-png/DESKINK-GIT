-- Ideally this should be more restricted (e.g. only if token matches) but 'true' is common for simple token lookup tables 
-- if the token is the only primary key or filter used. 
-- However, allowing ANYONE to dump the table is bad. 
-- Better: Let's rely on the RPC being Security Definer. 
-- If the React app queries query `studio_invitations` directly with a token filter, this policy is needed.
-- But given the error is INSERT, the first policy is the critical one.
